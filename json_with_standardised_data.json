Approximately 1 million people are living with MS in the US today.

Predominantly diagnosed in older adults, most patients are around the age of 70 when diagnosed, with men being twice as likely to develop WM as women. The condition is also more common among White individuals compared to other racial groups. WM leads to the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, resulting in symptoms such as extreme fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, and occasional nose or mouth bleeding.\nAlthough WM is generally incurable, it can often be managed as a chronic condition. Diagnosis involves detecting specific proteins in the blood and analyzing bone marrow samples. Treatment options have advanced over time and may include targeted therapies, antibody treatments, chemotherapy, and other medications to control the disease. Ongoing research aims to develop new treatments for patients who do not respond well to existing therapies. Despite improved survival rates with newer treatments, challenges remain, such as addressing disparities in disease impact across different racial groups and managing treatment side effects.",

    "disease_description": "About 85% to 90% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are 3 main subtypes of NSCLC. The cells in these subtypes differ in size, shape, and chemical make-up when looked at under a microscope. But they are grouped together because the approach to treatment and prognosis (outlook) are very similar.\n\nSquamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma:About 25% to 30% of all lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. These cancers start in early versions of squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in the lungs. They are often linked to a history of smoking and tend to be found in the middle of the lungs, near a bronchus.\n\nAdenocarcinoma:About 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas. These cancers start in early versions of the cells that would normally secrete substances such as mucus. This type of lung cancer occurs mainly in people who smoke (or have smoked), but it is also the most common type of lung cancer seen in non-smokers. It is more common in women than in men, and it is more likely to occur in younger people than other types of lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is usually found in the outer region of the lung. It tends to grow slower than other types of lung cancer, and is more likely to be found before it has spread outside of the lung. People with the type of adenocarcinoma called adenocarcinoma in situ (previously called bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) tend to have a better outlook (prognosis) than those with other types of lung cancer.\n\nLarge cell (undifferentiated carcinoma):This type of cancer accounts for about 10% to 15% of lung cancers. It may appear in any part of the lung. It tends to grow and spread quickly, which can make it harder to treat. A subtype of large cell carcinoma, known as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, is a fast-growing cancer that is very similar to small cell lung cancer.\n\nOther subtypes:There are also a few other subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, such as adenosquamous carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma. These are much less common\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most.

Some forms of MD are seen in infancy or childhood, while others may not appear until middle age or later. The condition is caused by genetic mutations that interfere with the production of muscle proteins necessary to build and maintain healthy muscles. The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common form of MD and primarily affects boys; Facioscapulohumeral MD usually begins in the teenage years and Myotonic is the most common adult form of MD. The most common types of MD are Duchenne (DMD), Becker, Myotonic, Congenital, Emery-Dreifuss, Fascioscapulohumeral, Limb-Girdle, Ocular and Oculopharyngeal.",

Urticaria often has a trigger that may be identified with new onset urticaria, however, in many cases a specific cause is never identified. This is often the case when the condition persists for weeks or months.\n\nUrticaria is commonly described as acute or chronic. When urticaria has been present for less than six weeks, it is diagnosed as acute. It is considered chronic when it is recurrent, meaning that the signs and symptoms have been present for most days of the week, for more than six weeks or longer. Lesions of acute or chronic urticaria are identical in appearance so it is not possible to distinguish between the two when the condition first develops.\n\nPhysical urticaria are hives that have a physical cause such as exposure to heat, cold or pressure.\n\nChronic urticaria should be evaluated by an allergist. Based on history, the patient may need allergy testing based on suspected triggers. Due to the possibility of anaphylaxis, allergy testing should be done under medical supervision with emergency medication and equipment available. Approximately one half of the cases of chronic urticaria as associated with some type of immune findings and can also be associated with thyroid disease, hormonal problems, and in rare cases, cancer.",

Hereditary or familial amyloidosis is rare, and is caused by inheriting a gene mutation; normally the harmful deposits don\u2019t occur until adulthood. There are 2 classifications of hereditary amyloidosis which is considered a systemic disease, ATTR (transthyretin protein (TTR)), and Non-TTR.

This causes the esophagus to become inflamed and not contract properly. The esophagus can also narrow and develop rings or abscesses. This condition can become worse over time.\n\nIn addition to trouble swallowing, symptoms may include chest pain or heart burn, reflux, abdominal pain, vomiting, food getting stuck in the throat due to narrowing, regurgitation, and failure to thrive which is more commonly seen in children.\nIt is believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in developing EoE. Approximately half of patients with EoE also have asthma or seasonal allergies. Others may have eczema or food allergies. Patients may have a combination of food allergies which increases the risk of EoE. It is seen most often in adult males with a mean age at diagnosis of 34 years. In children, the disease is more common in males as well.",

The parathyroid hormone helps maintain an appropriate balance of calcium in the bloodstream and in tissues that depend on calcium for proper functioning. Hyperparathyroidism can occur at any age, but is more common in people between age 50 and 60, and women are affected about three times as often as men.\nThere are two types of hyperparathyroidism, primary and secondary. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands are overactive causing an overproduction of the parathyroid hormone, resulting in high levels of calcium in the blood known as hypercalcemia.\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia and associated hyperplasia of the glands, in an attempt to keep the calcium levels normal. This disorder is especially seen in patients with chronic kidney failure and vitamin D deficiency.\nAt younger ages, Primary hyperparathyroidism is often caused by a familial hyperparathyroidism syndrome, which usually causes several of the parathyroid glands to enlarge rather than a single gland to become enlarged.",

Nearly all colon cancers begin as noncancerous (benign) polyps, which slowly develop into cancer. You have a higher risk for colon cancer if you:\n\n\u2022Are older than 60\n\u2022Are African American of eastern European descent\n\u2022Eat a diet high in red or processed meats\n\u2022Have cancer elsewhere in the body\n\u2022Have colorectal polyps\n\u2022Have inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis)\n\u2022Have a family history of colon cancer\n\u2022Have a personal history of breast cancer\nCertain genetic syndromes also increase the risk of developing colon cancer. Two of the most common are:\n\u2022Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n\u2022Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome\n\nWhat you eat may play a role in your risk of colon cancer. Colon cancer may be associated with a high-fat, low-fiber diet and red meat. However, some studies have found that the risk does not drop if you switch to a high-fiber diet, so this link is not yet clear. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are other risk factors for colorectal cancer.\u201d\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most.

It is an lg\u00a3 mediated reaction that involves the release of many chemical mediators resulting from the release of mast cells and the degranulation of basophils in response to a specific antigen.\n\nAnaphylaxis is an acute, life threatening rapidly evolving, multisystemic reaction. It is a medical emergency. Physical presentations can range from mild skin flushing and itching to severe respiratory symptoms. If untreated, it is often fatal due to respiratory collapse.\n\nIt is not unusual for clinical presentation to begin with mild symptoms. While flushing, itching, and hives are common, they may not develop until later in the exposure. For example, in oral exposures, fullness or a \u201clump\u201d in the throat, clearing the throat, or trouble breathing may be the first symptoms the patient experiences. Once symptoms are identified, rapid treatment with intramuscular epinephrine should be initiated. Approximately half of fatalities occur within the first hour. However, approximately 20% of cases are biphasic. This means that despite treatment in the initial phase, it is possible for symptoms to recur in eight to twelve hours after the initial reaction and treatment. It is important that the second reaction is not overlooked.\n\nWhile the focus is on respiratory and cutaneous symptoms along with hypotension, there may be other symptoms including abdominal pain, cramps, vomiting, syncope, and incontinence. It is possible to have an anaphylactic response without airway edema or respiratory complaints.",

    "disease_description": "Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar in the blood. Most of the food we eat is broken down into sugar and released into the bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, it signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps sugar from food get into cells to be used for energy.\n\nWith diabetes, the body either doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or can\u2019t use the insulin well. If there is too little insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in the bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.\n\nThe two main types of Diabetes are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin or impairs the body\u2019s ability to produce enough insulin. Type 1 diabetes is not a childhood disease, it occurs at any age, most often by early adulthood, in people of every race, shape or size, and has no known cure. Type 1 diabetes is also referred to as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes affects the way your body metabolizes sugar and is the most common type of diabetes mellitus. With type 2 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin, but the body is unable regulate the movement of sugar into the cells, this is known as insulin resistance or may occur when the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. Type 2 diabetes is also known as insulin-resistant diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes and adult onset diabetes.\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most.

Other types include Hemoglobin SC disease, Hemoglobin SB+ thalassemia, Hemoglobin SB-zero thalassemia, Hemoglobin SD, hemoglobin SE and Hemoglobin SO. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood, and people with sickle cell disease have ancestors that came from sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries, Saudi Arabia, India or from Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere. Sickle Cell Disease is also called HbS disease, Hemoglobin S Disease, SCD, Sickle cell disorders, Sickle cell anemia, SS disease and Sickling disorder due to hemoglobin S.",

Sympathetic paragangliomas grow along nerve pathways found in the head, neck, chest cavity, abdomen, pelvis and bladder, outside of the adrenal gland. Pheochromocytomas are a type of sympathetic paraganglioma that develop in the adrenal medulla of the adrenal gland. Sympathetic paragangliomas produce hormones called catecholamines, such as epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine control the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response in response to stress that can cause rapid heartrate, high blood pressure, breathing, headaches and sweating. These hormone surges can lead to life-threatening health problems, such as a stroke, heart attack, hemorrhage, or sudden death.\n\nThe majority of parasympathetic paragangliomas are located in the head, neck and skull base along the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves usually do not produce hormones. The parasympathetic nervous system controls involuntary body functions such as saliva production and digestion.\n\nParagangliomas are typically slow growing, but approximately 40-50% can become cancerous and spread distantly to other parts of the body. These tumors can affect people of any age but most often show up between the ages of 25 and 50, it is estimated that up to 25% of paragangliomas are inherited.

There are two types of left-sided heart failure (most common): The first is Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or systolic failure (HFrEF), this occurs when the heart is unable to contract normally and the heart cannot push enough blood into circulation. The second type is Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or diastolic failure (HFpEF), this occurs when the left ventricle loses its ability to relax normally, and can\u2019t fill with blood during the resting period. In right-sided heart failure, the right ventricle loses its pumping function, causing blood to back up in the venous system, producing congestion in the body\u2019s tissues. This causes swelling (edema) in the lungs, legs, ankles, around the eyes and swelling in the abdomen and liver (ascites). This is often seen following left sided heart failure. Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs when the left side of the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of oxygenated blood through the arteries due to weakness, which delays the return of oxygen-depleted blood from the veins. This process causes congestion in the body\u2019s tissues, resulting in edema in the lungs (pulmonary edema), abdomen, liver and lower body. There are four stages of CHF that range in severity depending on classification systems from Class 1 or A \u2013 don\u2019t experience any symptoms to Class IV or D \u2013 being unable to perform any physical activity without symptoms.",

Because of the different gene mutations, signs and symptoms range in severity and progress at different rates, but one thing they have in common is that all affected have a greatly shortened life expectancy, most people living only until their late teens or twenties. The disorders generally include a combination of vision loss, epilepsy, and dementia. Eventually, people affected with Batten disease become blind, wheelchair bound, bedridden, unable to communicate, and lose all cognitive functions. Treatment options are limited to therapies that can help relieve some of the symptoms.\n\nForms of the NCLs include: CLN1 disease, infantile onset, symptoms often appear before age 1; CLN1 disease, juvenile onset symptoms develop around age 5 or 6; CLN2 disease, late-infantile onset, developmental delay begins around age 2; CLN2 disease, later-onset abnormalities are noticed around age 6 or 7; CLN3 disease, juvenile onset \u2013 rapidly progressive vision loss seen between ages 4 and 7; CLN4 disease, adult onset (Kufs disease type B) begins in early adulthood around age 30; CLN5 disease, variant late-infantile onset seizures and myoclonic jerks usually seen between ages 6 and 13; CLN6, variant late-infantile onset with developmental delays and behavior changes seen in early childhood; CLN6, adult onset (Kufs disease Type A) seen in early adulthood with lack of balance or coordination; CLN7, variant late-infantile onset usually develop epilepsy between ages of 3 and 7 with a rapid advancement of symptoms seen between the ages of 9 and 11; CLN8 disease with Epilepsy with Progressive Mental Retardation (EPMR) with an onset of cognitive decline and seizures beginning between ages 5 and 10; CLN8 disease, late-variant onset affected children begin showing symptoms between ages 2 and 7, which include loss of vision, cognitive problems, unsteadiness, myoclonic jerks, and behavioral changes; CLN9, juvenile onset, symptoms usually seen around age 4; CLN10 congenital, neonatal and late infantile disease typically seen soon after birth.\n\nOther names for these diseases include: JNCL, Spielmeyer-Sjogren disease, Vogt-Spielmeyer disease, INCL, Balkan disease, Santavuori-Haltia Disease, Jansky-Bielschowsky disease, ANCL, Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis Finnish variant, CLN5 disease, juvenile, CLN5 disease, adult; Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Gypsy/Indian early juvenile variant, CLN8 disease, late infantile, CLN8 disease, Northern epilepsy variant, NCL, Northern epilepsy variant, Progressive epilepsy-intellectual disability, Finnish type.",

It can be very contagious and spreads quickly. Over one million people have died from COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, the flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than the lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of the body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill. Additionally, a person\u2019s age and overall health can put them at higher risk for the virus. People with underlying medical problems, receiving treatments that leave them immunocompromised, or having lung disease are more likely to develop serious illness. Some people including those with minor or no symptoms will develop Post-COVID Conditions \u2013 also called \u201cLong COVID.\u201d\n\nPost-Covid Conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that people experience after being infected with the virus that causes Covid-19. This term was formulated by the CDC to describe health issues that persist for more than four weeks after being infected with Covid-19. They include:\n\n\u2022 Long Covid (which consists of a wide range of symptoms that can last weeks to months) or persistent post-Covid syndrome (PPCS)\n\u2022 Multiorgan effects of COVID-19\n\u2022 Effects of COVID-19 treatment/hospitalization\n\nPost Acute Covid-19 Syndrome is emerging terminology which is classified as:\n\u2022 Subacute or persistent symptomatic COVID-19 symptoms (up to 12 weeks from the initial acute episode).\n\u2022 Chronic or post-Covid syndrome, symptoms present beyond 12 weeks.

The severity of MPS VII varies widely among affected individuals. The most severe cases of MPS VII are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Most babies with hydrops fetalis are stillborn or die soon after birth. Other people with MPS VII typically begin to show signs and symptoms of the condition during early childhood. The features of MPS VII include a large head , a buildup of fluid in the brain, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \u201c\u201dcoarse,\u201d\u201d and a large tongue. Affected individuals also frequently develop an enlarged liver and spleen, heart valve abnormalities, and umbilical hernia or lower abdomen hernia. The airway may become narrow in some people with MPS VII, leading to frequent upper respiratory infections and sleep apnea. The eye\u2019s cornea becomes cloudy, which can cause significant vision loss. People with MPS VII may also have recurrent ear infections and hearing loss. Affected individuals may have developmental delay and progressive intellectual disability, although intelligence is unaffected in some people with this condition.\u00a0 MPS VII is estimated to occur in 1 in 250,000 newborns. It is one of the rarest types of mucopolysaccharidosis. MPS VII causes various skeletal abnormalities that become more pronounced with age, including short stature and joint deformities (contractures) that affect mobility. Other names for this condition include: beta-glucuronidase deficiency, GUSB deficiency, MPS VII, Mucopolysaccharidosis 7, and Sly Syndrome.\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most.

    "disease_description": "Open Angle Glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. The eye constantly makes a fluid called aqueous humor. As new fluid is made in the eye, the same amount of fluid should drain, and this process should keep the intraocular pressure in the eye stable. The fluid drains out through a drainage angle. If this drainage angle is not working properly and fluid builds up, the pressure in the eye builds and causes damage to the optic nerve.\n\nThe optic nerve is made up of millions of tiny nerve fibers. When these nerve fibers die, a patient will develop blind spots in their vision. These blind spots may not be noticed until most of the optic nerve fibers have died. If all the fibers die, the patient will become blind. Open angle glaucoma happens gradually. The eye does not drain well, the pressure builds up and there is damage to the optic nerve. There is also evidence that there is a neuropathy of the optic nerve that contributes to this disorder. Not every patient diagnosed will have an increase in intraocular pressure. The optic nerve also takes on a disc shape known as \u201ccupping\u201d. Open angle glaucoma is painless and there is initially no damage. As open angle glaucoma progresses, peripheral field vision loss followed by central field loss is the typical pattern seen. Most patients do not notice a change in their vision until the damage is severe. Regular eye exams are important to detect early signs of damage to the optic nerve.\n\nRisk factors include:\n\n\u2022\tAge: Incidence increases in those over 55 years\n\u2022\tRace: The rate of blindness from glaucoma is 6.6 times higher in black people with blindness beginning 10 years earlier.\n\u2022\tFamily history is a significant risk factor\n\u2022\tElevated intraocular pressure (IOP)\n\u2022\tDiabetes\n\u2022\tHypertension",

    "disease_description": "Diabetic Retinopathy is a disease of the eye in people with diabetes that causes damage to the blood vessels of the retina and can lead to blindness. The blood vessels can swell and leak or they can occlude, preventing circulation in the eye.\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy has two main stages: Non-Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) occurs when tiny blood vessels leak and cause swelling in the center of the retina, the macula, it is called macular edema. This is the most common reason for vision loss in diabetic patients. Also, with NPDR the blood vessels in the retina can occlude causing macular ischemia. This can cause particles called exudates to form in the retina which can affect vision.\n\nProliferative Diabetic Retinopathy is the more advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy. In this stage, the retina begins to grow new blood vessels. These new vessels are fragile and often bleed into the vitreous portion of the eye. If they bleed a little, a patient may see dark floaters in their vision. If there is much bleeding it can block all vision. These new vessels can cause scar tissue which can damage the macula or lead to a detached retina. It is possible to have DR and not know it because it often has no symptoms in the early stages. As it progresses, patients notice symptoms such as:\n\n\u2022\tSeeing \u201cfloaters\u201d in the visual field\n\u2022\tBlurred vision\n\u2022\tVision that changes from blurry to clear\n\u2022\tPoor night vision\n\u2022\tNoticing that color appear faded or washed-out Loss of vision\n\nPatients should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist and treated to preserve vision.",

    "disease_description": "Colon, or colorectal, cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. However, early diagnosis can often lead to a complete cure. Almost all colon cancer starts in glands in the lining of the colon and rectum. When doctors talk about colorectal cancer, this is usually what they are talking about.\n\nThere is no single cause of colon cancer. Nearly all colon cancers begin as noncancerous (benign) polyps, which slowly develop into cancer. You have a higher risk for colon cancer if you:\n\n\u2022Are older than 60\n\u2022Are African American of eastern European descent\n\u2022Eat a diet high in red or processed meats\n\u2022Have cancer elsewhere in the body\n\u2022Have colorectal polyps\n\u2022Have inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis)\n\u2022Have a family history of colon cancer\n\u2022Have a personal history of breast cancer\nCertain genetic syndromes also increase the risk of developing colon cancer. Two of the most common are:\n\u2022Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n\u2022Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome\n\nWhat you eat may play a role in your risk of colon cancer. Colon cancer may be associated with a high-fat, low-fiber diet and red meat. However, some studies have found that the risk does not drop if you switch to a high-fiber diet, so this link is not yet clear. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are other risk factors for colorectal cancer.\u201d",

Adult-onset GHD or acquired growth hormone deficiency is most often acquired from a medical condition, pituitary tumor or trauma to the brain, but may also be idiopathic meaning there is no known cause. Adult symptoms vary but can include reduced energy levels, altered body composition, osteoporosis, reduced muscle strength, lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance, and impaired cardiac function.

Most of the food we eat is broken down into sugar and released into the bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, it signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps sugar from food get into cells to be used for energy.\n\nWith diabetes, the body either doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or can\u2019t use the insulin well. If there is too little insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in the bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.\n\nThe two main types of Diabetes are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin or impairs the body\u2019s ability to produce enough insulin. Type 1 diabetes is not a childhood disease, it occurs at any age, most often by early adulthood, in people of every race, shape or size, and has no known cure. Type 1 diabetes is also referred to as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes affects the way your body metabolizes sugar and is the most common type of diabetes mellitus. With type 2 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin, but the body is unable regulate the movement of sugar into the cells, this is known as insulin resistance or may occur when the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed in middle-aged or older people.

This causes swelling (edema) in the lungs, legs, ankles, around the eyes and swelling in the abdomen and liver (ascites). This is often seen following left sided heart failure. Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs when the left side of the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of oxygenated blood through the arteries due to weakness, which delays the return of oxygen-depleted blood from the veins. This process causes congestion in the body\u2019s tissues, resulting in edema in the lungs (pulmonary edema), abdomen, liver and lower body.

In Pompe disease, mutations in the GAA gene reduce or completely eliminate this essential enzyme.  Excessive amounts of lysosomal glycogen accumulate everywhere in the body, but causes the most damage to tissue structure and functioning in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Researchers have identified up to 300 different mutations in the GAA gene that cause the symptoms of Pompe disease, the severity of the disease and the age of onset are related to the degree of enzyme deficiency.  Pompe disease may also be classified as a glycogen storage disease, a group of metabolic disorders characterized by abnormalities involving the use and/or storage of glycogen.\n\nResearchers have described three types of Pompe disease, which differ in severity and the age at which they appear. The classic form or infantile-onset Pompe disease usually presents during early infancy (4-8 months of age); The non-classic form or infantile-onset Pompe disease usually appears by age 1 or 2; The late/later-onset type of Pompe disease may not become apparent until after age 2, adolescence, or adulthood. In general, the later the age of onset, the slower the progression of the disease. It is estimated that Pompe disease occurs in 1 in every 40,000 births.

    "disease_description": "Prostate cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of cancer cells in the prostate. Cancer can invade nearby tissue and spread to other parts of the body. In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men. The prostate is one of the male sex glands, located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is about the size of a walnut and it surrounds part of the urethra. The prostate makes fluid that becomes part of the semen. Prostate cancer typically grows at a slow rate. Once the outer rim of the prostate has been penetrated, the cancer may possibly spread (metastasize) directly into the channels of tissue and other major organs. If prostate cancer spreads, it initially attacks the lymph nodes enclosed in the pelvis. The risk for developing prostate cancer increases with age. Risk factors include being over 55 years old, having a family history of cancer, being African-American, having an enlarged prostate, and being exposed to sexually transmitted viral agents. In addition, diet and exercise may contribute to the risk for prostate cancer.",

Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress and suppresses inflammation. Exposure to too much cortisol can occur from long-term use of synthetic glucocorticoid hormones to treat inflammatory illnesses such as asthma, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Pituitary adenomas (benign tumors of the pituitary gland) can secrete excess amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), causing the body to overproduce cortisol. Tumors of the adrenal gland and ectopic ACTH producing tumors (benign or malignant) can cause problems with cortisol balance. The condition usually occurs in adults between the ages of 20 and 50, however, children may also be affected, and the disease affects females more often than males.\n\nOther names for this condition include hypercortisolism, pituitary ACTH hypersecretion, pituitary Cushing syndrome, pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism, pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism disorder.",

    "disease_description": "Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle, causing the heart muscle to become enlarged, thick, or rigid. The condition makes it harder for the heart to fill with blood, pump blood throughout the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm.\u00a0 The three most common types of cardiomyopathy are dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive, and can be acquired (develops due to another disease, condition or factor), or inherited. Cardiomyopathy can affect people of all ages and races. The forms of cardiomyopathy include:\n\nThe most common type of dilated cardiomyopathy is Ischemic cardiomyopathy. The heart\u2019s ability to pump blood is decreased because of enlargement (dilation) of the left ventricle usually related to coronary artery disease or blockages in the arteries supplying the heart with blood and oxygen. Often related to prior myocardial infarction/heart attack.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically occurs due to genetic disease or mutation in the cardiac muscle proteins. \u00a0The abnormal proteins result in the heart chamber (left ventricle) becoming thicker than normal and not relaxing (filling with blood) between beats.\u00a0 The resulting stiffness is termed nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, the heart may contract in such a way as to block outflow of blood to the body, reducing the amount of blood taken in and pumped out to the body with each heartbeat.\u00a0 This is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nA variety of mutations are associated with enlargement of the left ventricle and failure to pump an adequate supply of blood to the body and compiled these mutations are termed other genetic or familial cardiomyopathies. These diseases are generally characterized by the absence of other common causes of heart failure such as coronary artery disease.\n\nTransthyretin (trans-thy-re-tin) amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an infiltrative disease (amyloidosis) that is often underdiagnosed and potentially fatal disease of the heart muscle. In ATTR-CM, a protein called transthyretin that normally circulates in the bloodstream becomes misshapen and builds up in the heart, nerves, and other organs. When these amyloid deposits build up in the heart, the walls can become stiff, making the left ventricle unable to properly relax and fill with blood \u2013 called diastolic dysfunction. As the condition progresses, the heart can become unable to adequately squeeze to pump blood out of the heart, leading to heart failure.\n\nOther infiltrative cardiomyopathies can be caused by a variety of metabolic diseases. The heart\u2019s ventricles become rigid because abnormal tissue replaces the normal heart muscle. Consequently, the ventricles cannot relax normally and fill with blood, and the atria become enlarged. Blood flow in the heart is reduced over time. This can lead to problems such as heart failure or arrhythmias.\n\nSimilarly, cardiomyopathy can be developed by toxic causes such as therapeutic treatments and other medicines, environmental agents, illicit substances and natural toxins.\u00a0 These may or may not be transient and are termed toxic cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe cause of cardiomyopathy may or may not be able to be identified.\u00a0 Cardiomyopathy without an identified cause is termed Idiopathic cardiomyopathy and is generally characterized by the absence of other common causes of heart failure such as coronary artery disease.",

Macular degeneration is referred to as a low vision condition since peripheral vision remains intact. AMD is most common in white adults, affecting one in 14 people over the age of 40, ultimately affecting almost a third of seniors over the age of 80.\nThere are two forms of macular degeneration, wet (neovascular) and dry (non-neovascular).\nWet AMD, is when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, these blood vessels may leak, causing scarring of the macula. While Wet AMD is less common, accounting for 10% to 15% of cases, it causes a relatively sudden change in vision that result in serious vision loss.\n\nDry AMD is common in people over 65, accounting for 85% to 90% of cases, and usually affects both eyes. Dry AMD causes blurred vision or visual distortions as a result of aging along with thinning of macula tissues, or the depositing of yellowish pigment (drusen) under the retina or may be a combination of the two processes. \u201c",

The disorder leads to aggressive atherosclerosis, which if left untreated, causes individuals to experience heart attacks or death before age 30. Many patients with homozygous FH must undergo LDL apheresis on a regular basis. LDL Apheresis is a process by which blood is removed, LDL-C is filtered out, and then the person\u2019s blood is returned to their body. It is similar to dialysis.

Covered tests are genetic tests to determine the risk of developing cancer based on heredity and genomic testing to diagnose cancer, identify mutation, determine treatment and monitor cancer growth. The fund does not cover procedures to get sample tissues, x-rays, MRIs, or scans/lab work outside of genetic and genomic tests. The fund also does not cover direct to consumer tests not prescribed by a physician.\n\nInformation About the Tests\n\nGenetics is the study of single genes and their role in the way traits or conditions are passed from one generation to the next. Genetic alterations can be inherited from one\u2019s parents, caused by environmental factors, or occur during natural processes such as cell division, and account for 90 to 95 percent of all cases of cancer. Genetic testing involves looking at the specific inherited changes or mutations in the chromosomes, genes or proteins that humans are born with and their role in the ways traits or conditions are passed from one generation to the next. Genetic testing can also be used to examine mutations that have been acquired in genes after birth.\n\nCancer is a group of diseases caused by changes in DNA that alter cell behavior, causing uncontrollable growth and malignancy. These abnormalities can take many forms, including DNA mutations, rearrangements, deletions, amplifications, and the addition or removal of chemical marks.\n\nGenomics describes the study of all parts of an organism\u2019s genes. Genomic tumor testing can tell one type of cancer or subtype of the cancer from another, identify the DNA alterations that are driving the growth of a particular tumor, as well as gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer growth, metastasis, and/or drug resistance. Precision medicine uses the specific information about the tumor to help diagnose, select optimal therapies based on the context of the patient\u2019s genetic profile, determine how well a treatment is working or make a prognosis.\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most.

Individuals with Hemophilia B tend to bleed longer not faster than unaffected individuals, with bleeding often occurring in the muscles and joints. The disorder can be severe, moderate or mild based on the activity level of factor IX. Hemophilia B is also called Christmas Disease or Factor IX deficiency.

In most cases, the defect in the GLA gene causes a deficient quantity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (Gb3) which is needed to breakdown lipids (fatty substances) in the body. When proper metabolism of this lipid and other similar lipids does not occur, Gb3 accumulates in the majority of cells throughout the body. The resulting progressive lipid accumulation leads to damage and organ dysfunction in the body\u2019s cells, particularly affecting small blood vessels, the heart and kidneys. The cell damage causes a wide range of mild to severe symptoms including progressive kidney damage, heart attacks and strokes often at a relatively early age. Fabry disease can affect males and females of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nThere are two major disease phenotypes: type 1 \u201cclassic\u201d and type 2 \u201clater onset\u201d subtypes. Type 1 occurs in 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 males, with symptoms beginning in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms increase with age, primarily due to progressive glycolipid accumulation in the micro-vascular system. Type 2, or later onset, is more frequent occurring in I in 1,500 to 4,000 males. Classic symptoms of Fabry disease include a dark-red, spotted skin rash in the trunk (angiokeratoma), reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), burning or hot pain in the hands and feet triggered by stress, fatigue or fever (acroparesthesias), and clouding of the corneas.\n\nOther names for this condition: alpha-galactosidase A deficiency, Anderson-Fabry disease, angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, angiokeratoma diffuse, ceramide trihexosidase deficiency, GLA deficiency, hereditary dystopic lipidosis and lysomal storage disorder",

Mast cell activation disorder (MCAD), is an immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release chemical mediators as a hyper-reaction to foreign bodies or injury, sometimes causing anaphylaxis or a near-anaphylaxis attack. The two major forms of mast cell disorders are mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS). Mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal accumulations of mast cells in the skin, bone marrow and internal organs. There are two main forms of mastocytosis: cutaneous and systemic, and is usually caused by a mutation in the KIT gene. The second type of MCAD is mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). MCAS can cause a wide range of unpleasant and sometimes debilitating, symptoms in any of the different systems of the body, frequently affecting several systems at the same time. The onset of MCAS is often sudden, affecting both children and adults, and can mimic other conditions. Mast cell activation syndrome can be classified into primary (clonal proliferation), secondary (due to specific stimulus), and idiopathic (no identifiable cause).",

In myasthenia gravis, antibodies (immune proteins) block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which prevents skeletal muscles from contracting, resulting in fluctuating weakness in voluntary muscle groups, which tends to improve with rest. There are two clinical forms of myasthenia gravis: ocular and generalized. In ocular myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness often first appears in the muscles of the eyelids and other muscles that control movement of the eye (extraocular muscle). In generalized myasthenia gravis, the weakness involves the ocular muscles and a variable combination of the arm, legs, and respiratory muscles.\n\nMyasthenia gravis affects both men and women and occurs across all racial and ethnic groups. It most commonly impacts young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60), but it can occur at any age, including childhood. It is estimated that approximately 20 in 100,000 people are affected and may occur in more than one member of the same family.",

This is a life-saving or prolonging life therapy for patients with end-stage organ diseases for hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide.\n\nComplications can arise with graft rejection due to mismatched Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and are found on the outside surface of cells including Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC) receptors. The MHC receptors present a peptide to T lymphocytes where these cells will destroy a pathogen. When there are no destructive pathogens, homeostasis can be achieved. When tissues are transplanted with mismatched HLA, this can elicit a very strong cytotoxic T cell immune response against transplanted tissues\nPeople who have had an organ transplant need antirejection or immunosuppressive medications. They weaken your immune system and decrease your body\u2019s ability to destroy your new organ. But they also decrease how well your body can fight infections, cancer, and other diseases.\n\nThrough rapid improvements in immuno-suppressive drugs, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, surgical and anesthetic techniques, and careful pre-operative and post-operative medical surveillance, long-term success rates approaching 80% in five years are achievable in liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung transplant recipients. There are many ways to enhance success in this complex process, including appropriate donor and recipient selection, minimization of peri-operative allograft (donor organ) injury, appropriate use of anti-rejection and anti-infection medications, and close post-operative surveillance for rejection, infection, and recurrent disease.",

Due to the lack of hemoglobin, the red blood cells don\u2019t function properly and last a shorter amount of time, so fewer healthy red blood cells are available to carry oxygen to the body. There are two main types of thalassemia: alpha thalassemia (caused by mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes) and beta thalassemia (caused by mutations in the HBB gene), that refer to the part of hemoglobin that is not being produced, resulting in anemia. Thalassemia affects men and women equally; severe forms are usually diagnosed in early childhood and are lifelong conditions. Thalassemia is also called alpha-thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia, Hemoglobin H-Constant Spring, Hemoglobin H Disease and Cooley\u2019s anemia.",

The severity of MPS VII varies widely among affected individuals. The most severe cases of MPS VII are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Most babies with hydrops fetalis are stillborn or die soon after birth. Other people with MPS VII typically begin to show signs and symptoms of the condition during early childhood. The features of MPS VII include a large head , a buildup of fluid in the brain, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \u201c\u201dcoarse,\u201d\u201d and a large tongue. Affected individuals also frequently develop an enlarged liver and spleen, heart valve abnormalities, and umbilical hernia or lower abdomen hernia. The airway may become narrow in some people with MPS VII, leading to frequent upper respiratory infections and sleep apnea. The eye\u2019s cornea becomes cloudy, which can cause significant vision loss. People with MPS VII may also have recurrent ear infections and hearing loss. Affected individuals may have developmental delay and progressive intellectual disability, although intelligence is unaffected in some people with this condition.\u00a0 MPS VII is estimated to occur in 1 in 250,000 newborns. It is one of the rarest types of mucopolysaccharidosis. MPS VII causes various skeletal abnormalities that become more pronounced with age, including short stature and joint deformities (contractures) that affect mobility.

There are two types of ITP, acute and chronic. Acute ITP is most commonly seen in young children, with boys and girls being equally affected. This is the most common form of ITP. Symptoms often, but do not necessarily, follow a viral infection. About 85 percent of children recover within 1 year and the problem doesn\u2019t return. Chronic ITP can occur at any age, the symptoms last a minimum of six months to several years. This form usually occurs in adults, but can also occur in adolescents.

Covered tests are genetic tests to determine the risk of developing cancer based on heredity and genomic testing to diagnose cancer, identify mutation, determine treatment and monitor cancer growth. The fund does not cover procedures to get sample tissues, x-rays, MRIs, or scans/lab work outside of genetic and genomic tests. The fund also does not cover direct to consumer tests not prescribed by a physician.\n\nInformation About the Tests\n\nGenetics is the study of single genes and their role in the way traits or conditions are passed from one generation to the next. Genetic alterations can be inherited from one\u2019s parents, caused by environmental factors, or occur during natural processes such as cell division, and account for 90 to 95 percent of all cases of cancer. Genetic testing involves looking at the specific inherited changes or mutations in the chromosomes, genes or proteins that humans are born with and their role in the ways traits or conditions are passed from one generation to the next. Genetic testing can also be used to examine mutations that have been acquired in genes after birth.\n\nCancer is a group of diseases caused by changes in DNA that alter cell behavior, causing uncontrollable growth and malignancy. These abnormalities can take many forms, including DNA mutations, rearrangements, deletions, amplifications, and the addition or removal of chemical marks.\n\nGenomics describes the study of all parts of an organism\u2019s genes. Genomic tumor testing can tell one type of cancer or subtype of the cancer from another, identify the DNA alterations that are driving the growth of a particular tumor, as well as gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer growth, metastasis, and/or drug resistance. Precision medicine uses the specific information about the tumor to help diagnose, select optimal therapies based on the context of the patient\u2019s genetic profile, determine how well a treatment is working or make a prognosis.",

The most common presentation is a sudden onset of systemic inflammation symptoms that lasts at least two weeks including high recurring daily fever spikes, accompanied by a salmon-pink skin rash over the body, often occurring later in the evening before returning to normal.

Unlike other forms of juvenile arthritis, joint problems may not develop until weeks after systemic symptoms appear, most commonly begin in the knees, wrists and ankles. The disease course is variable and can be just a single episode of illness, repeated bouts of illness, or in the worst cases, constant illness. Boys and girls are equally vulnerable, but accounts for 10 percent of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis cases.

NPD is divided according to the altered gene and symptoms. Niemann-Pick Types A (NPA) the most severe form, occurs in early infancy causing profound brain damage leading to an early death, is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene. Niemann-Pick Type B (NPB), also caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene, usually occurs in pre-teen years with symptoms including ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, affects the liver, spleen and lungs, but generally does not affect the brain. Most people affected with NPB survive into adulthood. Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) can appear at any age, is divided into Type C1, caused by a mutation in the NPC1 gene, affects the brain and gut; while Type C2, caused by a mutation in the NPC2 gene, is more severe than Type C1 but mostly affects the lungs. C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. NPC individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have seizures. The majority of children with NPC die before age 20 and it is rare for any person with NPC to reach age 40.\n\nOther names for this condition: lipid histiocytosis, neuronal cholesterol lipidosis, neuronal lipidosis, NPD, sphingomyelin lipidosis, sphingomyelin/cholesterol lipidosis and sphingomyelinase deficiency",

AAT, the alpha-1 protein, is mainly produced by the liver. The main function of AAT is to protect the lungs from inflammation caused by infection and inhaled irritants such as tobacco smoke. The low level of AAT in the blood occurs because the gene that controls production and release is abnormal and cannot release AAT from the liver at the normal rate. This leads to a build-up of abnormal AAT in the liver that can cause liver disease and a decrease of AAT in the blood that can lead to lung disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic condition, often undiagnosed. Age of onset and severity of AATD can vary based on how much ATT an affected person is missing. In adults, symptoms may include shortness of breath; reduced ability to exercise; wheezing; respiratory infections; fatigue; vision problems; and weight loss. Some people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Liver disease (cirrhosis) may occur in affected children or adults.\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) may first be suspected in people with evidence of liver disease at any age, or lung disease (such as emphysema), especially when there is no obvious cause or it is diagnosed at a younger age. Confirming the diagnosis involves a blood test for low AAT and genetic mutation of the SERPINA 1 gene.",

    "disease_description": "Breast cancer forms in tissues of the breast, usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). It occurs in both men and women, although male breast cancer is rare.\n\nBreast cancer affects one in eight women during their lives. Breast cancer kills more women in the United States than any cancer except lung cancer. No one knows why some women get breast cancer, but there are a number of risk factors. Risks that you cannot change include:\n\n\u2022Age \u2013 the chance of getting breast cancer rises as a woman gets older\n\u2022Genes \u2013 there are two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, that greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested.\n\u2022Personal Factors \u2013 beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55\n\nOther risks include being overweight, using hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy), taking birth control pills, drinking alcohol, not having children or having your first child after age 35 or having dense breasts.\n\nSymptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in size or shape of the breast or discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exam and mammography can help find breast cancer early when it is most treatable. Treatment may consist of radiation, lumpectomy, mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy.\u201d\n\nOur Health Equity Funds were developed to get assistance to those people and places who need it the most. Developed using the CDC\u2019s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and CDC Disease Incidence data, our Health Equity Funds serve people living in 226 counties across the United States that have been identified by the CDC as having the highest social vulnerability scores and are burdened with high rates of chronic diseases. The Health Equity Funds are designed to specifically provide support to eligible patients living in one of the 220 counties covered by the funds, which is verified using the zip code of the patient\u2019s home address. All other eligibility requirements, and fund operation, are the same as our general funds.",

    "disease_description": "About 85% to 90% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are 3 main subtypes of NSCLC. The cells in these subtypes differ in size, shape, and chemical make-up when looked at under a microscope. But they are grouped together because the approach to treatment and prognosis (outlook) are very similar.\n\nSquamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma:About 25% to 30% of all lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. These cancers start in early versions of squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in the lungs. They are often linked to a history of smoking and tend to be found in the middle of the lungs, near a bronchus.\n\nAdenocarcinoma:About 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas. These cancers start in early versions of the cells that would normally secrete substances such as mucus. This type of lung cancer occurs mainly in people who smoke (or have smoked), but it is also the most common type of lung cancer seen in non-smokers. It is more common in women than in men, and it is more likely to occur in younger people than other types of lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is usually found in the outer region of the lung. It tends to grow slower than other types of lung cancer, and is more likely to be found before it has spread outside of the lung. People with the type of adenocarcinoma called adenocarcinoma in situ (previously called bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) tend to have a better outlook (prognosis) than those with other types of lung cancer.\n\nLarge cell (undifferentiated carcinoma):This type of cancer accounts for about 10% to 15% of lung cancers. It may appear in any part of the lung. It tends to grow and spread quickly, which can make it harder to treat. A subtype of large cell carcinoma, known as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, is a fast-growing cancer that is very similar to small cell lung cancer.\n\nOther subtypes:There are also a few other subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, such as adenosquamous carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma. These are much less common",

It causes painful joints with redness, heat and swelling in surrounding tissues that can lead to damage to joints if the inflammation is not controlled, especially those of the lower extremities, distal joints of the fingers and toes, the back and sacroiliac joints of the pelvis. Nail changes and dactylitis (sausage like appearance of fingers or toes) are two features that are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis, although they do not appear in all cases. The condition usually appears in people between the ages of 30 and 50, both men and women are equally at risk. Psoriatic arthritis is categorized into five types: distal interphalangeal predominant, asymmetric oligoarticular, symmetric polyarthritis, spondylitis, and arthritis mutilans.",

The propensity of viruses to infect cells selectively in particular organs is referred to as tropism (either on cellular or organ level), which is dependent on both viral and host factors.\n\nTesting provides the means for the primary identification of a wide variety of viral infections (such as respiratory viruses, herpes viruses, enteroviruses, and many others), the monitoring of viral load in chronic disease (HIV, HCV, and HBV), and the quantitative assessment of viral infection or reactivation after transplantion and in other immunocompromised patients (CMV, EBV, and BK). Serological tests are used to show the presence or absence of antibodies to a specific virus, and can confirm a specific viral diagnosis while helping in determining prognosis.\n\nExamples of virology testing would include immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmune precipitation and Western blot assays. Molecular techniques (such as polymerase chain reaction or PCR) are widely used for diagnostic clinical virology.\n\n\n\n",

There are two types of hemophilia both of which are caused by different mutations on the X chromosome. Hemophilia A is caused by a lack or decrease in factor VIII, a specialized blood protein necessary for blood clotting. People with this disorder experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled; internally bleeding often occurs in the muscles and joints. The disorder can be severe, moderate or mild, with 50-60% of people having the severe form of the disease. The disease is more common in males, and affects people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Hemophilia A is also called classic hemophilia or Factor VIII deficiency hemophilia and is four times as common as hemophilia B. Hemophilia B is caused by a lack or decrease in factor IX, which is needed for blood clotting. Individuals with Hemophilia B tend to bleed longer not faster than unaffected individuals, with bleeding often occurring in the muscles and joints. The disorder can be severe, moderate or mild based on the activity level of factor IX. Hemophilia B is also called Christmas Disease or Factor IX deficiency. There is an unusual form known as Hemophilia B Leyden that has excessive bleeding in childhood but causes few problems after puberty. The disease is more common in males, and affects people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds.",

    "disease_description": "Bipolar disorder (BD), formerly known as manic-depressive illness or manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes unusual changes in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks. These moods range from periods of extremely elated, irritable, or energized behavior (manic episodes) to sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (depressive episodes). It is a chronic disease that affects the psychology system. Subtypes include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder (cyclothymia). A fourth subtype, bipolar disorder, other specified and unspecified, occurs when a person does not meet the criteria for other subtypes, but has still experienced clinically significant periods of abnormal mood elevation.",

The attack occurs at the connection between nerve and muscle (the neuromuscular junction) and interferes with the ability of nerve cells to send signals to muscle cells. Specifically, the immune system attacks the calcium channels on nerve endings that are required to trigger the release of chemicals (acetylcholine). In people with LEMS, the lowered levels of acetylcholine are not sufficient to cause normal muscle contractions, causing muscle weakness. (SOURCE: Muscular Dystrophy Association)",

    "disease_description": "Hunter syndrome is a very rare, inherited genetic disorder caused by a missing or malfunctioning enzyme. In Hunter syndrome, the body doesn't have enough of the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase. This enzyme's job is to break down certain complex molecules, and without enough of this enzyme, the molecules build up in harmful amounts. The buildup of massive amounts of these harmful substances eventually causes permanent, progressive damage affecting appearance, mental development, organ function and physical abilities. Hunter syndrome is far more common in boys. The condition is one type of a group of inherited metabolic disorders called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs). Hunter syndrome is also known as MPS II.

Pulmonary hypertension can happen on its own or be caused by another disease or condition. The increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. If left untreated, the increased pressure can damage the heart. This may lead to serious or life-threatening complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, which are irregular heart rhythms. (SOURCE: National Institutes of Health)",
